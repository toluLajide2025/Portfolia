# Library System

## [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ualberta-cmput291/w24-mp1-code-casters)

## Project Overview

This project is a command-line based **Library Management System** developed as part of a group assignment at the University of Alberta. The application simulates a simplified library environment where users can:
- log in
- search for books
- return borrowed books
- pay penalties for late returns
- and manage their member profiles.

Each team member was responsible for designing and implementing specific user-facing functionalities. The program was built with modular components to handle user interactions, input validation, and basic transaction logic.

To ensure reliability, we implemented guard clauses for invalid inputs and conducted thorough testing by creating diverse test scenarios, focusing especially on edge cases such as overdue returns and invalid member actions. 
Documentation and UML diagrams were also included to support future development and maintenance.

## My Contributions (Tolu Lajide)

- Implemented the **Return a Book** functionality:
  - Displayed a list of current borrowings for the user.
  - Enabled selection of books to return.
  - Integrated **penalty calculations** based on the return time and due date.
  - Allowed users to leave **written reviews** upon returning a book.

- Conducted thorough **testing** by providing different input scenarios to ensure the output was correct and all edge cases were handled.

- Collaborated with teammates by integrating my feature into the main system and reviewing program output for accuracy.
