## Project Overview
This Android application was built as part of a group project for a Software Engineering at the **University of Alberta**. The app allows easy and efficient event management with features for event creation, QR code generation, tracking attendance, managing event details, communicating via push notifications, and much more.

## My Role
- Developed a QR code generation feature using the **ZXing library**, including a dedicated manager class that encodes event IDs into scannable QR codes.
- Documented code with **JavaDoc** and created **UML diagrams** to outline system structure and class relationships.
- Wrote **unit tests** for the profile and event classes, and performed testing on administrator functionalities.
- Implemented and refined the **edit event** feature, allowing organizers to modify event details smoothly.
- Improved the app's navigation by adding gesture-based swiping between QR codes and linking organizer functionalities through a simplified menu.
- Built a **milestone tracking system** with four preset milestones and developed an **auto-notification feature** that alerts users when a milestone is reached at app startup.
- Refactored milestone logic to increase performance and better integrate with event workflows.
- Enhanced the **user interface** across multiple organizer-related components for better usability.
- Helped integrate database functionality using **Firebase** to have a realtime database
